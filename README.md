# Inverted-Search

Inverted search, also known as an inverted index, is a data structure and technique used in information retrieval to efficiently search and retrieve documents or records based on keywords or terms. 

It's commonly employed in search engines, databases, and various applications where quick and efficient text-based searches are essential.

# Process

Initially, data collection is essential, gathering the text-based documents or content to be indexed.

Following this, tokenization and preprocessing are performed, breaking down text into meaningful terms and applying adjustments like stemming and lowercase conversion. 

The heart of the process is the construction of the inverted index, mapping terms to document occurrences. 

This is done by iteratively processing each document, updating the index with term-document associations. 

Storage solutions are chosen to house the index, while query processing involves tokenizing and scoring user queries, returning relevant documents. 

Finally, testing, documentation, deployment complete the iterative process of implementing an efficient inverted search system.

# Learnings and Challenges :

-->understanding hashing and indexing.

-->arranging the words to specific node while travelling through word and file list.

-->faced challenges during the storing of same word data which are in deifferent files.
